            <p>You gotta see it to believe it
                <br>Sky never looked so blue
                <br>So hard to leave it
                <br>That's what I always do
                <br>So I keep thinking back to
                <p class="cmoon"> A time under the canyon moon</p>
            <p>The world's happy waiting
                <br>Doors yellow, broken, blue
                <br>I heard Jenny saying
                <br>"Go get the kids from school"
                <br>And I keep thinking back to
                <p class="cmoon">A time under the canyon moon</p>
            <p>I'll be gone too long from you</p>
            <p>Staring at the ceiling
                <br>Two weeks and I'll be home
                <br>Carry the feeling
                <br>Through Paris, all through Rome
                <br>And I'm still thinking back to
                <p class="cmoon">A time under the canyon moon</p>
            <p>I'm going, oh, I'm going
                <br>I'm going, oh, I'm going
                <br>I'm going, oh, I'm going home</p>
            <p>I'm going, oh, I'm going
                <br>I'm going, oh, I'm going
                <br>I'm going, oh, I'm going home</p>
            <p>Quick pause in conversation
                <br>She plays songs I've never heard
                <br>An old lover's hippie music
                <br>Pretends not to know the words
                <br>And I keep thinking back to
                <p class="cmoon">A time under the canyon moon </p>
            <p>I'll be gone too long from you</p>
            <p>I'm going, oh, I'm going
                <br>I'm going, oh, I'm going
                <br>I'm going, oh, I'm going home</p>
            <p>I'm going, oh, I'm going
                <br>I'm going, oh, I'm going
                <br>I'm going, oh, I'm going home</p>
            <p>I'm going, oh, I'm going
                <br>I'm going, oh, I'm going
                <br>I'm going, oh, I'm going home (hey)</p>
