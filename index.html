        <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
        <p>1. My name is Lauren Pavelec, and I am a senior studying communication design and marketing.</p>
        <p>2. As a BA in design, this class was one option of required classes for my major and I thought it would be a great skill to have and interesting to learn.</p>
        <p>3. I do not have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn more about code and especially how to code a website, make it work smoothly, and look well designed.</p>
        <p>5. I think designing for screen will be different than designing for paper because it takes user experience into account and making a webpage functional rather than just aesthetics.</p>
        <p>6. https://www.sylvain.co is a strategy and design agency that makes really awesome work, and I loved their website. It is super well designed, and I think it shows off their talent as an agency in an effective way. </p>
        <p>7. https://www.apple.com I think apple's website is very clean and easy to navigate and therefore exemplifies effective communication of their brand and products. </p>
        <p>8. https://www.airbnb.com Airbnb has a great website because the homepage is well designed and it's very well laid-out, making it easy to navigate. </p>
